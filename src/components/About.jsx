          Hello and welcome! I'm Deep Sankar De, and I'm excited to have you
          visit my virtual space. My journey in the world of technology began at
          Techno International Newtown, where I enthusiastically pursued a
          Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. The allure of the digital
          realm, especially the art of web development, captured my imagination
          from the very beginning. Through diligent exploration, I've become
          well-versed in a range of essential tools including HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, and the dynamic capabilities of React. My path in web
          development has been marked by curiosity and a commitment to mastering
          the intricacies of coding. From the canvas of a blank HTML document to
          the finesse of CSS styling, and the interactive functionalities woven
          with JavaScript and React, I've learned to orchestrate these elements
          into symphonies of user-friendly and visually remarkable websites. The
          journey of a novice developer comes with its challenges, but it's
          within those challenges that I find the fuel for my continuous growth.
